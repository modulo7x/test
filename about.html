						<h2>About Us</h2>
						<p>The history and mission of Pure Shaolin</p>
					</header>
					<img class="image featured" src="photos/about_top.jpg" alt="" />
					<p>Pure Shaolin Kung Fu Academy teaches the Chinese arts of kung fu, tai chi and other physical
						forms that generate constructive energy for harmony of the body, the spirit and the world. In
						these arts, the important point is that the mind is not separate from the body. How one moves
						and behaves in physical ways can affect and enhance how one can build a healthy lifestyle.</p>
					<p>Pure Shaolin Kung Fu Academy was founded in 2005 with the primary focus on Northern Shaolin Kung
						Fu. Today, we have grown into a sports academy with many diverse goals such as promoting
						cultural exchange between China and the United States, providing the public with authentic
						instruction in Chinese martial arts, training the Wushu teams for national and international
						competitions and serving as a resource center for our students. Pure Shaolin Kung Fu has a
						variety of programs for all ages and skill levels from beginner to advanced. We strive to
						provide a positive learning experience for all of our students.</p>
					<p>The word “Shifu” in Chinese is made of two words: “Shi” meaning teacher, and “Fu” meaning parent.
						As Shifus, we not only teach kung fu skills as a teacher, but also care about a student's
						personal growth as a parent. Our goal is for our students to lead proper lives, interact
						respectfully with others, and work both independently and with a team. We want our students to
						learn to have a growth mindset, face challenges, and overcome them. These things take priority
						over the kung fu techniques we learn in class.</p>

					<h3>Shifu David</h3>
					<p>Master Xu De Zheng, or Shifu David, has had over 20 years of experience teaching kung fu and tai
