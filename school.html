									<h3>Parties!</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Pure Shaolin is not just about training. We take time to celebrate various events as
									well. Every Chinese new year, our Kung Fu school organizes and runs a dumpling
									party. The party allows our Kung Fu family to experience traditional Chinese culture
									and celebrate the year's achievements. The party consists of performances,
									activities and the dumpling potluck. The party helps bring together our Kung Fu
									community and increases the bond between shifus, parents, and students. The parties
									are alway a good time, and we hope to make our parties a continuing success. In the
									future, we plan to run more events, including a Halloween party and an Easter party.

								<h2>Life at Pure Shaolin</h2>
								<p>Constant self-improvement</p>
							</header>
							<img class="image featured" src="photos/school_top.jpg" alt="" />
							<p>To be a champion, one should look at the big picture. It's not about winning and losing;
								it's about working hard every day and thriving on challenge. It's about embracing the
								hardships that you'll experience in order to arrive at the end of race and not being
								afraid. Through kung fu, we build up a student's character and strengths. The shifus
								have different teaching styles that all students will learn from. We adapt to each
								individual student's needs. We stress the importance of proper pacing to avoid injury
								and to increase a student's confidence. The diverse nature of kung fu training helps
								students discover their own individual strengths.</p>

							<h3>Belt Testing</h3>
							<p>Belt testing gives students the opportunity to show what they have learned and represents
								a measurable level of improvement. It requires a vast knowledge of your current belt
								level's skills. In order to belt test, you must not only be deemed proficient in the
								Kung Fu skills you have learned, but also display growth outside of the studio.</p>
							<p>Each time you take a belt test, you do three things: demonstrate that you understand and
								can execute the required skills to meet your new belt level, reaffirm your past
								knowledge, and display your recently acquired knowledge and skills. At the end of the
								test... celebrate! Celebrating builds your confidence and self-esteem. You deserve it!
							</p>

							<h3>Competitions</h3>
							<p>Every year, our students go to many competitions on the local, national, and
								international level. Competitors are judged on a variety of criteria, including power,
								balance, and skill. While getting a medal is surely a rewarding event, competition isn't
								just for getting medals. Competition provides a valuable learning experience
								unobtainable during regular class. The added pressure teaches students on how to handle
								stressful environments, while encouraging them to push themselves to constantly improve.
								In comparing themselves to their peers, students can gauge their current skill level
								while learning from the performances of their peers. There are no losers in competition.
								Every competitor learns something new with each competition.</p>

							<h3>Performances</h3>
							<p>Throughout the year, our students take part in many different performances. Performances
								allow students to increase their confidence and overcome stage fright, while also
								providing a platform for them to show off what they have learned. Performances also are
								a valuable community service, allowing the student to be an active member of their
								community.</p>
