						<h2>Summer Camp</h2>
					</header>
					<img class="image featured" src="photos/summer.jpg" alt="" />
					<p>During summer we have a special program for intensive training in a specialized topic. Our summer
						camp students train 3 hours a day, 5 days a week over 4 weeks.</p>
					<p>In 2022 our summer camp theme is <i>The Art of Boxing</i>, focusing on boxing and self-defense.
						This class is inspired by the book <i>The Art of War</i> by Sun Tzu, written 2500 years ago. It
						has been recognized by the world and has been translated to many languages. The book is one of
						the great works of strategy. It represent a coherent approach to all forms of conflict, and the
						underlying principles can be applied in countless scenarios. It dives deep into the mathematical
						part of fights: calculating your opponents's strength compared to yours, strategizing how to use
						your environment to your advantage, disadvantages of the environment for you, and more. Using
						these calculations you can find the chance of winning against your opponent. In this program we
						will not only help you increase your strength in combat through boxing, but also teach you how
						to use math to increase your chance of winning. <i>The Art of War</i> includes 36 different
						strategies. We focus on 1 of the 36 strategies in each week.</p>

					<h3>Reviews from Art of Boxing Summer Camp</h3>
