					<h3>Little Dragons (Ages 4-5)</h3>
					<p>Our Little Dragon program is designed for young children and encourages the development of
						self-confidence, strength, coordination, motor skills, and personal awareness. The children
						explore and expand their individual abilities, as well as social and listening skills while
						learning in a safe, positive, and fun atmosphere. At Pure Shaolin, we work individually with
						each child on five different basic martial arts skills: 1) kicking techniques, 2) punching
						techniques, 3) rotating and jumping, 4) tumbling routines and 5) learning traditional kung fu
						forms. The art of kung fu requires balance, body control and physical strength, as well as the
						mental strength to maintain focus and concentration at all times. Learning Chinese martial arts
						requires a lot of practice and training, but if your child enjoys excitement and challenge, then
						he or she will truly love the study of kung fu.</p>

					<h3>Junior Dragons (Ages 5-10)</h3>
					<p>The goal of the Junior Dragons classes is to develop a positive attitude toward physical
						accomplishment through safe, strong, and accurate martial arts training. The Junior Dragons
						curriculum is designed to promote strength, balance, flexibility and muscular development. As
						Junior Dragons progress in their training, the self defense program will adjust to the physical
						size and development of their bodies. Weapons are introduced at an early stage of training to
						enhance the understanding of various kung fu forms. We believe that all children are capable and
						ingenious individuals. Chinese kung fu is a medium for kids to explore and build on their
						physical, mental and emotional capabilities. It is a sport that presents challenges in new and
						exciting formats that is pure fun for kids. The developmental skills gained through taking kung
						fu classes lay the foundation for many other sports. In addition, the personal lessons learned
						through goal setting, perseverance and self reflection are useful for a lifetime of adventures.
					</p>

					<h3>Dragon Team (11 and up)</h3>
					<p>The Dragon Team is for college bound athletes who demonstrate sustained achievement throughout
						their training. Dragon training will nurture leadership skills, character, and motivation. By
						developing the whole person, we will cultivate tenacity, initiative, responsibility, insight,
						maturity, respect and concern for others. With confidence and concentration, our athletes will
						exhibit intellectual independence, originality, and a healthy sense of community. Dragons are
						encouraged to join the Kung Fu Team to train for international kung fu standards of competition
						which may qualify them for scholarships. It is our desire to promote an atmosphere of family and
						a martial arts community that mutually supports kung fu philosophy and spirituality. We want our
						members to take a disciplined approach to the respect of self and others. Our program is
						designed to help our students access their inner strength, build confidence and healthy
						self-esteem to achieve a balanced life, and make positive contributions to the world around
						them.</p>
